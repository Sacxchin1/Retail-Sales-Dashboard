# Retail-Sales-Dashboard

The dashboard explores the impact of different customer segments on sales and profitability for various product categories. By addressing these questions, the project aims to draw valuable conclusions from the "Super Store Sales" Dataset and contribute to informed decision-making for the retail company.
